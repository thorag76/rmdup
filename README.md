# What it does
Walks through the given directory recursively and deletes duplicate files that match the given regex.
File comparison is done by sha-256 based hash. The tool tries to ensure there is always at least one copy left of the file.

# How to use it
Just pass it the dir and regex and pray :D

# Important Notice
Use at own risk - the author is not liable for any data loss caused by using this tool.
And yes... I'm not a Perl expert and never will be. Next tool will be made with Python :-P
